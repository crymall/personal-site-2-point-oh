	<h2>hi there.</h2>

	<p>you can call me <span class="bold">Reed.</span></p>

	<p>
		i'm a <span class="bold">writer</span>, a <span class="bold">programmer</span>, a
		<span class="bold">teacher</span>, a <span class="bold">photographer</span>, and most
		importantly, someone trying to make his own little place in the world, just like you.
	</p>

	<p>
		in my work, i'm looking to collaborate on interesting projects with capable, kind people. i'm
		particularly moved to make a positive social impact, and to share and acquire knowledge across
		disciplines.
	</p>

	<p>
		currently, i'm based in new england, and i'm open to remote and local opportunities, including:
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="bold purple">web development</span>, <span class="bold blue">photography</span>, <span class="bold red">teaching</span>, <span class="bold green">online advertising</span>, <span class="bold yellow">copywriting</span>, and anything adjacent
		to those pursuits.
	</p>

	<p>
		for now, i prefer freelance, but if you have something different in mind, feel free to drop me a
		line.
